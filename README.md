# About Chrominia
Chrominia was conceived as a miniature project tracker for people who build and paint miniatures figures for tabletop games, such as tabletop war games (e.g., WarHammer), tabletop RPGS (e.g., Dungeons & Dragons), and board games (e.g., Scythe). 

Chrominia was built in Unit 3 of our Software Engineering Immersive at General Assembly. Unit 3 was primarily focused on learning React and its role in a MERN-stack application. An additional requirement was implementing token-based authentication.
