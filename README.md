# About Chrominia
Chrominia was conceived as a miniature project tracker for people who build and paint miniatures figures for tabletop games, such as tabletop war games (e.g., WarHammer), tabletop RPGS (e.g., Dungeons & Dragons), and board games (e.g., Scythe). 

Chrominia was built in Unit 3 of our Software Engineering Immersive at General Assembly. Unit 3 was primarily focused on learning React and its role in a MERN-stack application. An additional requirement was implementing token-based authentication.

# Future Goals
Chrominia was original created as both a project tracker and social app; however, due to the constraints of time, the original social functionality was largely left unimplemented. In the future, we'd like to implement a "friends" feature and a commenting feature. We'd also like to implement a larger "super project" feature, where the user could bundle projects together (e.g., a whole Sister of Battle army could contain a Celestine project, an hospitalier project, a tank project, etc). Finally, we'd like to implment two more schemas - notes & paint recipes - in order to add more features for the user as they are fleshing out their projects.
